    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Annyeongggg! It's name Rabeena Dangol and I'm a student pursuing a degree in Information Technology. I have a deep curiosity about how technology work.

        <p>
          Besides my academic pursuits, I work in Co-operative as a Accountant and have good knowledge bout money transactions, documentation, loan paperwork and transactions as well.

        <p>
          I also enjoy learning full stack as it allows me to have a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end aspects of web development.
